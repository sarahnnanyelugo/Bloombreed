                As we look to the future, we understand the need for students to understand themselves and their
                    strengths—for each student to have a sense of their own social and emotional wellbeing.</P>

    We understand it’s going to be increasingly important for students to develop
    the skills of resilience and perseverance. There used to be a belief that schools
    could not teach character, that kids were born with a specific set of personalities
     and dispositions. Now, as we understand more how character develops, we know we can
     teach students how to be happy, how to embrace positive things
    in the world around them, and how to impact others in ways that are meaningful and engaging.

<p><strong>FORMAL DINING:</strong> Our students, gorgeously adorned in their formal evening
    attires, are equipped with the best rules of civility at this specially
    organised banquet which serves to nourish their appetite for a top-notch
    dining etiquette as well as a well-nourishing dinner. The formal dining exposes
     our students to various dishes at local and
     international level while they get to savour the various enticing courses of meals served.
    <br><br> <strong>CAREER DAY:</strong> We know our students on an individual basis and understand their career
    and academic trajectory.
    In order to provide them with a wider range of selectable projections suited to their academic
     and career needs, we have partnered with some A-list universities and colleges within Nigeria and
      beyond to offer professional consultancy services to our students in terminal classes. During our
       annual career fair, representatives of universities and colleges satisfy our students and parents’
        numerous concerns such as available scholarship opportunities, eligibility criteria, CV writing
         amongst others.

     <br><br> <strong>CHARITY VISIT/OUTREACH:</strong> Just as we have ingrained empathy and care into the learning
     of our students, our corporate social responsibility of charity outreach to orphanages reinforces
      our belief in honourable service and conduct which are our core values. The benevolent donations
      from our amiable parents
      and sponsors rekindles hope in the lives of the children at various orphanage homes we visit.

<br><br><strong>DISCIPLINE:</strong> Our model of discipline is all about responsibility. In Bloombreed schools,
 we value and treasure the uniqueness of each student, therefore we have at our disposal, professional
 and seasoned educators at the helm of preventive, supportive and corrective disciplinary and remedial
 programmes both in academics and conduct. Corporal punishment of any kind is disallowed, whereas, our
 students are groomed
to take initiative, be an upstander and be modest in conduct, appearance and conversation.
