     are encouraged to take risks, try new things, and learn what their passions are in life.</p>

<p></span style="font:bold">Our Grade 6-8 program offers a challenging academic curriculum which fosters
    exploration, critical thinking, and innovative learning. Our framework is geared towards creating
     dynamic, compassionate, and connected learners. <br><br>Our curriculum is based on
     <span style="color:#5B80F0">AERO</span> and <span style="color:#5B80F0">Common Core</span>
      standards and is tailored to our unique context and learners. Common Core and AERO are standards
       widely adopted by international schools. For families transitioning between schools, this offers
        a sense of familiarity and provides consistency in your childâ€™s education.<br><br> We believe our students
         should be active participants in their own learning with the expectation that they become
          independent and reflective of the world around them. To complement our framework, a
     variety of student support and extracurricular programs are offered to enrich the Middle School journey.

    <strong>TARGET (Teen, Action, Reflection, Growth, Exploration, Teamwork)</strong><br><br> TARGET,
    our Middle School advisory program, aims to meet the needs of young adolescents
    by providing structured guidance and support. <br><br>The TARGET program seeks to create
     a sense of belonging and promotes a positive self-image to ensure that each student
     is connected and advocated for.<br><br><strong>Discovery Program </strong><br>The Discovery Program is an extensive
     electives program in which students have the opportunity to pursue new areas of interest
     in a low risk, low pressure environment. <br><br>The Discovery Program is agile in design and
     exploratory by nature, enabling Middle School students to try something new outside of
     the usual curricular framework.
