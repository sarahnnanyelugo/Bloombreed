<p style="color:rgb(36,43,105)!important; font-weight:bolder">BMS Middle School (Grades 6 - 8) is a place for discovery and growth, where students
     are encouraged to take risks, try new things, and learn what their passions are in life.</p>

<p></span style="font:bold">Our Grade 6-8 program offers a challenging academic curriculum which fosters
    exploration, critical thinking, and innovative learning. Our framework is geared towards creating
     dynamic, compassionate, and connected learners. <br><br>Our curriculum is based on
     <span style="color:#5B80F0">AERO</span> and <span style="color:#5B80F0">Common Core</span>
      standards and is tailored to our unique context and learners. Common Core and AERO are standards
       widely adopted by international schools. For families transitioning between schools, this offers
        a sense of familiarity and provides consistency in your childâ€™s education.<br><br> We believe our students
         should be active participants in their own learning with the expectation that they become
          independent and reflective of the world around them. To complement our framework, a
     variety of student support and extracurricular programs are offered to enrich the Middle School journey.

    our Middle School advisory program, aims to meet the needs of young adolescents
    by providing structured guidance and support. <br><br>The TARGET program seeks to create
     a sense of belonging and promotes a positive self-image to ensure that each student
     is connected and advocated for.<br><br><strong>Discovery Program </strong><br>The Discovery Program is an extensive
     electives program in which students have the opportunity to pursue new areas of interest
     in a low risk, low pressure environment. <br><br>The Discovery Program is agile in design and
     exploratory by nature, enabling Middle School students to try something new outside of
     the usual curricular framework.
