<p >The Bloombreed Campus library is a dynamic, energetic, balanced,

     Reading for choice, love, and learning are the primary goals for this space, along with
      ensuring that students have the skills required to be informed digital citizens and researchers,
       capable of exploring their own independent inquiries.<br><br> Lessons are guided by the teacher librarian
        and constructed in collaboration with our elementary school teachers and the PYP Coordinator to
         ensure relevancy to classroom learning. Students are encouraged to develop a love of reading
    as they begin to understand how to use and utilize a library space to benefit their lear
    ning needs.</p>

      a deeper understanding of themselves and the world around them.
